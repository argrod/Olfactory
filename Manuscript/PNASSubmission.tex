Seabirds are highly adapted ocean inhabitants, spending upward of 90\% of their lives at sea \citep{Balance_2019}, reflecting the time spent travelling to and from foraging locations. As such, foraging efficiency is largely determined by their ability to travel to a prey patch due to the large distances they must often travel \citep{Weimerskirch_2003}. How seabirds find prey has formed much debate in the scientific literature. Seabirds have developed a number of foraging methods, both in prey capture techniques and search behaviours \citep{Shealer_2001}. This variety in behaviours is reflected in the range of scientific literature available on the topic of seabird foraging. However, details on seabird foraging are as yet relatively scarce. 

\section{The senses of a seabird}
Avian travel has long held interest concerning the ability of birds to correctly and efficiently decide on travel headings to reach intended destinations. Efficient foraging requires seabirds to identify productive areas across the featureless oceans they travel. Seabirds must travel long distances, both during migrations and foraging trips. Therefore, directing travel is vital in optimising foraging efficiency, and so understanding their means of navigation during foraging trips is paramount.

% VISUAL
\subsection{Visual senses}
%VISUAL VS OTHER SENSES
Visual cues are effective methods by which information of local conditions (prey presence) can be passed on between individuals. This 'local enhancement' exchanges information of successful foraging spots. The form of these visual cues are largely made up of conspecific or other seabirds rafting on the water surface \citep{Weimerskirch_2010b}, or associations with marine predators that are well documented in the scientific literature \citep{Nevitt_1999, Sakamoto_2009a, Silverman_2004, Thiebot_2012}. These associations indicate that the visual senses are important to these animals in choosing foraging spots, as presence of these visual cues indicate a high likelihood of prey, and so potential energy gain. Similarly, use of visual guides to direct birds to nesting grounds has been suggested in previous studies, using coastlines as visible markers to follow \citep{Pollonara_2015,Yamamoto_2008}.

% SOCIAL
\subsection{Social transfer and memory}
Visual cues and local enhancement are restricted by the visual range of the searching individual. At greater distances, it is unlikely that visual cues are sufficient to guide seabirds to prey patches, especially when flying over a potentially hazy environment which may be concealed by cloud cover. The relatively direct tracks recorded of seabirds travelling to foraging spots or homing \citep{Weimerskirch_2007b,Pollonara_2015} indicate a strong navigation system involved in directing travel headings. Seabirds and large marine predators can associate known areas with persistent prey presence \citep{Davoren_2013}, and so an initial heading may be garnered from past trips. However, following this initial heading, birds must rely on some means to navigate towards likely foraging spots, particularly as they come into closer proximity to prey patches. Sharing information across conspecifics would optimise foraging trips through directing travel to known productive foraging spots. The "information center hypothesis" (ICH) theorises that such information is spread at the returning site of central place foragers, i.e. nest colonies. Such transfer of information passes on knowledge of locations of previous foraging spots, beyond visual ranges of the colonies. However, little evidence of ICH as a mechanism for information transfer at scales greater than those of visual cues exists \citep{Davoren_2003}.

% GEOMAGNETIC
\subsection{Avian geomagnetism senses}
Birds are reported to sense the Earth's geomagnetic field through receptors in their eyes and use it to orient and navigate over long distances, particularly during migration \citep{Wiltschko_2011,Hiscock_2016}. While this research has focussed on small, primarily terrestrial passerines, some experiments on seabirds have explored the relative use of geomagnetic senses in navigation. Magnets attached to Scopoli's shearwaters (\textit{Calonectris diomedea}) performing foraging trips showed no difference in navigation ability in comparison to control birds, suggesting the role of geomagnetism during such trips is reduced in comparison to other sensory input.

% OLFACTORY
\subsection{Avian olfactory senses}
% SEABIRD HEADINGS AND FINDING PREY
Homing pigeons (\textit{Columba livia}) have gained reputations as skilled navigators, capable of returning to a home site regardless of their release point. Debate about the means by which pigeons direct their travel began a line of avian research surrounding the use of atmospheric odours. Nerve sectioning to induce anosmia in pigeons was one of the initial indications of the reliance of birds on olfaction to navigate, as anosmic birds' orientations were greatly distributed \citep{Papi_1972}. The concept of an 'odour map' was conceived and developed as a way for birds to orient themselves based on odour characteristics of their environment \citep{Papi_1972,Bonadonna_2003}. Such discussion has focussed on seabirds, wide-ranging animals that primarily travel over a featureless landscape. Tube-nosed seabirds (of the order Procellariiformes) in particular have received attention due to their enhanced olfactory apparatus \citep{Bang_1960, Bang_1971, Jacobs_2012}. The development of theories regarding use of olfaction in seabirds began to spread across the scientific community following studies involving Procellariiform seabirds displaying attraction to artificial oil slicks \citep{Grubb_1972,Dell_Ariccia_2014,Nevitt_1995,Nevitt_1999,Nevitt_2000}. These studies showed attraction of Procellariiformes to artificial concentrations of cod liver oil and/or dimethyl sulphide (DMS). DMS is a naturally occurring by-product of decomposition of dimethylsulphoniopropionate, produced when zooplankton graze on phytoplankton. DMS is therefore an indicator of zooplankton presence, ergo indicative of high productivity \citep{Cantin_1996,Dacey_1986,Jean_2009,Sim__2001}. Abilities of Procellariiformes to detect DMS has similarly been shown through experimental testing. Blue petrel chicks (\textit{Halobaena caerulea}) displayed sensitivity to picomolar concentrations of DMS in controlled experiments \citep{Bonadonna_2006}.

Both these components of foraging are important in reconstructing the ecology of a species and understanding how their foraging behaviour may change in response to changes to its environment and/or prey abundance. Seabirds provide a unique case of intrigue for researchers due to their wide-ranging nature and the environment which they inhabit. How these animals find prey is a question that has formed much debate in the scientific literature.

% BIOLOGGING
\section{Studying seabirds through biologging}
% BIOLOGGING HISTORY
Studying behaviours of marine species has inherent difficulties in observing these species both above and, more importantly, below the water surface. The field of biologging, where tags recording data attached to animals enable collection of information on their movements during natural behaviours, provided an innovative solution to this challenge. This information can then be used to infer behaviour or explore the effects of external factors of study species. Since the inception of biologging, using capillary tubes and ink to measure maximum pressures experienced by seals during dives \citep{Kooyman_1965}, development of smaller and more sophisticated tags has expanded the possibilities of biologging studies through recording of novel data types and the use of innovative analytical methods \citep{Kooyman_2004}. In biologging studies, ensuring tagged individuals do not experience any reduction of fitness or ability to perform typical behaviours is paramount. This is a key factor when conceiving a biologging-based study and has proved to be a considerable challenge in previous research \citep{Gessaman_1988, Bowlin_2010}. As flight and flight efficiency is of utmost importance to seabirds, tag mass is a key factor in ensuring this lack of unintended impact during tag deployments. As a result, tagging of seabirds is often limited by the relative mass of tags to the tagged individual's body mass.
