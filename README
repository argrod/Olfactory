# Shearwater olfactory sensory reliance

In this project, I am exploring seabird reliance on olfactory senses for the detection and orientation toward foraging spots. This project was largely undertaken as a part of my PhD at the University of Tokyo and involved data collected on streaked shearwaters (*Calonectris leucomelas*) from Funakoshi Oshima island in northeastern Japan. Shearwaters were tagged with [AxyTrek Marine](https://www.technosmart.eu/axy-trek-marine/) data loggers that recorded tri-axial acceleration and GPS.

A [previous project](https://github.com/argrod/BehaviourDetection) on [foraging behaviour detection](https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0254454) developed a foraging classification method using acceleration records of free-ranging shearwaters. This method provided reliable locations and durations of foraging behaviours for recorded seabirds. This data was combined with a [wind detection method](https://www.science.org/doi/10.1126/sciadv.1700097) to investigate shearwater flight with the context of local wind conditions.

Part of my project was to rewrite the wind estimation method in Python to be integrated with a [Biologging Intelligence Platform](https://www.bip=earth.com).
